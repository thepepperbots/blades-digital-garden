I am Caitlyn Mullan, and despite the empire's best efforts and narratives, I still live.

I would like to apologize to the Skovish people here in Doskvol, not only for what you have been going through, and do go through on a daily basis, but also for lacking the ability, as well as the perspective, to do anything about it until now. For a year and a half now, I have had to skulk around in the shadows, and avoid using my name just to get by. Just to ensure I would not be arrested, or more likely, gunned down where I stood. I had also been far too myopic in my vengeance and anger, focusing my efforts instead on who I deemed directly responsible for the murder of my parents, rather than those who gave the order in the first place.

Well, my friends, I have been to Blackvale. I have seen the empire try its absolute damnedest to take its victory and completely erase our culture, our history, our very identities. And I will die before I see that erasure happen anymore. I will die before I let the empire take anything more from us.

They are cowards. They always have been. They couldn't win the war via force OR peace, so what do they do? Grab a group of people straight from Lord Governor Dunvil's Deathland dog-fighting program, promise them the world and a better life, and send them off to go stick knives in my parents' backs.

The recent "activities" in the city have those in positions of power quivering in fear and anxiety. They are throwing heaps of coin at the Bluecoats, begging for them to respond to the aggression in kind, all without knowing how folly it is, how deep our anger and spite run.

And I say 'our', because I am tired of sitting in the shadows, watching, knowing I could be out there, helping you all. I am tired of waiting for the handful of Skovish nobility here in the city to at least pretend that they care about anything beyond themselves. And until they at least lift a finger, throw a coin, have a passing thought about what change they could try and shepherd, then well, as far as I'm concerned, they're just as complicit as the empire they're bootlicking for their cushy positions.

I'm one of the most wanted people in the empire. What are your excuses?

I want to help. I want to facilitate. I want to fight. I want to negotiate. And if you all will have me - and I understand if you wouldn't at this point - I want to rally. I want to be for you all, something I never got the chance to be. A princess.
