Former Master Auger for the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/The Forsyth Ship\|Forsyth]]. [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/Rook\|Rook]] was his apprentice during her tenure on the ship.

Vassa served both [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/William Forsyth Jr\|William]] and [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/William Forsyth Sr\|William Sr]] as an Auger.

He lived in a house with a painter, Raffaello, who's patron was the Coleburn family. Raffaello has since fled or is presumed dead.

He frequents a bar in the "XX" district called the Veil, which is run by Vollorus, a Tycherosi with a serpent body.

Vassa orchestrated a ritual in the Void sea involving the [[Blades in the Dark/Supernatural Entities/Dream Leviathan\|Dream Leviathan]]. After investigating using the imprints in the ghost field, it was discovered that Rook was made a part of his ritual, and it caused her to either travel to or "experience" a life in another world. (Later this world would be known as [[Blades in the Dark/Places/Cabar Sgiath\|Cabar Sgiath]].)

He has made a deal with an unknown demon, possibly to escape the consequences of his ritual with the Dream Leviathan.

Recently, Vassa has been working for [[Meyer\|Meyer]], Strangford's Master Auger. It's unknown how willingly he's doing so, but he wishes to use something as leverage to leave her service.
