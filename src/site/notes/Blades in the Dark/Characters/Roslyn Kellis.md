[[Blades in the Dark/Characters/H.C.\|HC]]'s childhood friend, whom she considered a sibling. The two of them grew up together, both taking lessons from [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/Cormac\|Cormac]]. It's currently unknown what the Kellis family's exact relationship with the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Skovlan Royal Family\|Skovlan Royal Family]] was.

HC considers Roslyn the cause for her parents' deaths.

Roslyn has leanings into the occult, is proficient as a whisper. Was either aligned with [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/The Circle of the Flame\|The Circle of the Flame]] or attempting to gain membership.

Her early plans were to work with [[The Brigade\|The Brigade]] to set fire to and damaging [[Lord Scurlock\|Lord Scurlock]]'s various businesses throughout Doskvol.

She was later seen at the premiere of Maestro Helleran's "Ghostly Orchestra", which Scurlock was in attendance. She and others were attempting to use the malfunctioning orchestra machines as a cover to steal something. When this plan was thwarted, she later asked Rook to distract Lord Scurlock so that they could attempt a new plan.

After these several attacks, Scurlock hired the Nameless to capture her and bring her to one of his safehouses.

Roslyn has been forcefully bound in some way to Scurlock with a ritual pact and cannot break it. Despite this, she is still actively planning against him and is aware, somewhat, of his plans to "throw Doskvol into chaos".
