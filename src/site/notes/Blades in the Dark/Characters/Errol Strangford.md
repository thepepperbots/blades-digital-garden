[[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Doskvol Council\|Doskvol councilor]], [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Strangford Family\|family patriarch]], and member of the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh\|Church]].

A powerful man within a powerful Doskvol noble family. He is shrewd, calculating, and dangerous. He is probably the biggest threat to the Nameless Coven, outside of the Emperor himself, and likely is because his focus is ever sharpening on the crew's dealings and interference.

**Black Market Auction**
	While at a black market auction for antiquities and art, the Skovlan Royal Portrait was revealed as an item.
	Though the auction was held as invitation only in a secret location in the Undercity, and all of its participants wore masks, it wasn't hard to deduce Strangford's identity from both his mask and from the amount of money spent on acquiring the portrait.

**Stealing Back the Portrait**
	At HC's request, the Nameless took on the task of breaking into the Strangford estate and stealing the portrait of the Skovlan Royal Family.
	The portrait was not held within the gallery or personal archive, but instead, it was being held in a secret office and makeshift laboratory underneath the manor.
	The Nameless found not only the portrait, but some strange bone charms, an envelope with dark hair strands, and a note from Lady Kellis: "I believe this should do."
	Another room directly off of this one held a strange "mermaid"-like creature, shackled to a bed and held in a deep slumber.

**Strangford's Party**
	Strangford held a party for the nobility on his flagship, the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/The Crucifix Ship\|Crucifix]], taking it outside Doskvol's lightning barrier. The party was meant to show off the black-market-acquired portrait of the Skovlan royal family, which included [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/H.C.\|H.C.]], but that was foiled in an earlier score by the Nameless. Instead, paintings from Raffaello were shown, along with the announcement that the artist "had sadly passed away".
	We learned that Strangford's sailors are [[Blades in the Dark/Supernatural Entities/Hollowed\|Hollowed]], including everyone working for him on this ship during the party.
	Strangford also intended to perform a ritual, using his connection to the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh\|Church]] as the fa√ßade. The lightning barrier was lowered, and Madeline and HC witnessed a strange otherworldly location where Strangford appeared to be searching through specific participants' memories. The [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Doskvol Council\|Doskvol Council]] seemed to be his primary target along with Madeline.
	When his ritual was ended because of Rook, Sully, and Barker's interference, he intended to place the blame of the resulting ghost attack on Sully, but Madeline and the others quickly intervened and earned Strangford's ire.

**Raid on the Forsyth**
	While on the contract mission out to coordinates in the Void Sea set by William Jr (acting as Booker), the Forsyth ship ran afoul of Strangford's fleet as it was hunting their Leviathan prey, the Deep Lord of Woe.
	An attack by raiders on the Forsyth ship was thwarted thanks to the Nameless's discovery of the plot early on in the trip. The raiders consisted of four humans in stolen Spark Runner gear and a brainwashed Hull. Their orders were to subdue the Captain, neutralize Rook, and take down the ship's lightning barrier. Above all else, their orders were to make sure that Booker's mission succeeded.
	It's unclear how much of this plan was ordered or known directly by Strangford, as all questioning of the raiders and the saboteurs pointed to the mastermind being [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/Meyer\|Meyer]], the Crimson Queen.
