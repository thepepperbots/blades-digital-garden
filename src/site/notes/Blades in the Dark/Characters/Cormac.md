As a young man, he gained acceptance into the legendary Onyx Citadel, a place where many of the most renowned Leviathan Augers trained. The Tyrannical King Mullen, who started the Unity War, brought him on as council and as a tutor to his daughter, the late and false queen Catherine Mullen. Colm achieved the rank of Ollam under the Citadel's award, meaning he was a very recognized bard of history.
