Possibly the resting place or corpse of a Leviathan that was killed by the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/Strangford Family\|Strangford Family]] 200 years ago.

[[Wit Booker\|Wit Booker]] had repeatedly used his position as Dive Captain to make several dives to the Well. He later told Rook that he saw William in the Well. At the time, we understood this to be William Sr. However, he meant [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/William Forsyth Jr\|William Jr]], and the encounter was literal, as William Jr went on to possess Booker after that encounter.

We later learned in more detail of when William Jr died on the Forsyth ship. The incident occurred near the Well, and rather than his spirit being released, it was caught within the Well.
