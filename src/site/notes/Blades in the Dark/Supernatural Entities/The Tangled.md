Demon who has a strong affinity for rats, possibly controlling hoards of them within the city.

Madeline encountered something that resembled the Tangled while in the strange space of Strangford's ritual on the Crucifix. She was released from the ritual after a swarm of rats attacked her in a memory from her youth.

The "Rat Man" was encountered in the Deathlands outside of the distillery used as a headquarters for the Muddy Eels. He devoutly worshipped the Tangled to the point where he looked more rat than human. He wanted to make the Muddy Eels gang "pay for breaking their oaths" and causing the death of someone important to him.
