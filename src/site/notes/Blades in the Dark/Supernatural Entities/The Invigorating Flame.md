Entity or demon that has temples devoted to her in the Undercity.

Vengeful, fickle with their blessings.

Possible other names or "domains": the Keeper, the Queen, the Embers, the Flame, the Unbroken Sun

Her symbol has appeared on an individual who attempted to kidnap or overtake H.C. It was tattooed on their hand, and glowed when activated. Later we learned that this was [[The Corvid\|The Corvid]].

Madeline recognizes this symbol from [[Slate\|Slate]]'s personal quarters. Slate had a shrine to this entity.

Slate's obsession with Madeline lead to Abigail's capture, and she was taken to a abandoned temple to the Flame in the Undercity. Slate had been trying unsuccessfully to gain the Flame's favor.

When Rook killed Slate, Slate's spirit was empowered, possibly by the Flame. The Corvid was there, claiming to live in this abandoned place. He witnessed Slate's death and agreed to help keep the spirit in check so that the Nameless could escape.
