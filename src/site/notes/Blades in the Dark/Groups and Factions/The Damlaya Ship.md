Fast, Iruvian-made ship owned by the Pastarrs, a fallen Iruvian noble family that left Doskvol.

Named after "damlaya damlaya", meaning "drop by drop", which is part of a common Iruvian saying: "Drop by drop makes a lake."

Was working as a skimmer ship, following Doskvol Leviathan hunting ships and fleets. These are common enough to be considered "scavengers" and aren't well regarded even if they bring in more Leviathan materials and goods to port.

Recently, Ahmid Pastarr proposed an exchange with Madeline and the [[Blades in the Dark/Groups and Factions/The Forsyth Ship\|Forsyth ship]]: Contract the Damlaya to assist with Leviathan hunts, and they would smuggle H.C. and the Blackvale resistance's goods to Doskvol.
