The Crucifix is the flagship of the [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/Errol Strangford\|Strangford]] family fleet.

Strangford doesn't lead any hunts except for one during the beginning of the season and, even then, stays well away from the actual hunting action.

Commander Marcus Mayhew is the current captain of the Crucifix.

Meyer is the Master Auger of the Crucifix.
