Occult group that is aligned against [[Lord Scurlock\|Lord Scurlock]].

Had attempted to use [[Blades in the Dark/Characters/Roslyn Kellis\|Roslyn Kellis]] against Lord Scurlock, either for their own gain or to grant her initiation.

Cormac mentions that his primary contact with the Circle of the Flame was [[Venn\|Venn]], who seems aligned with them or at least working with them.

Rook accompanied Venn to a meeting with Circle members in the underground channels. They are assisting with a ritual to "speak" with the skull of [[Blades in the Dark/Supernatural Entities/Kotarr\|Kotarr]]. Venn wants to ask questions and the Circle members can ask questions in exchange. One of the members is a man whose left arm has a lattice work tattoo that looks like two stag horns.
